# WebGL_TexturesAndModels

This code allows the creation of 3 figures: sphere, cube and pyramid.
All of them can be translated using the "wasd" keys, rotated, or scaled using the mouse wheel.
The light can be moved and changed color. You can delete an object from the canvas after selecting it from
the drop-down menu and then pressing the "del" button. Aside from 3 lights, which can invidualy be manipulated, you can 
load textures and models.
